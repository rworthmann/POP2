      <p class="term">
        Any advertising content shall always be marked as such. Publication of advertising content on the Websites does not mean that we endorse, approve, recommend, promote, or in any other way support the advertisers, their products or services.
        The advertisers are independent entrepreneurs with whom mutual rights and obligations regarding advertising on the Websites are regulated through separate contracts. Therefore, we are not involved in any possible relationship you may
        establish with the advertisers regarding their advertising content available through the Websites. Any rights and obligations arising from such relationships shall be regulated directly with the corresponding advertiser. Also, for any
        comments or information related to advertising please contact the advertiser directly.
        Since we do not control or supervise content available through advertisements, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, truthfulness, origin, content or availability thereof. However, we shall make every reasonable effort to ensure that advertising
        effectuated through the Website does not contain any prohibited content. Therefore, we reserve the right, but do not assume the obligation, to remove any advertising content, without prior notice and without explanation, based on our own

      <h2 class="termsection-heading">REFUND & CANCELLATION POLICY</h2>

      <p class="term">
        Due to the nature of our documentation templates & documentation toolkits, we do not offer any refunds once the order has been placed and your template has been delivered under any circumstances. Because we only sell digital goods, these
        products are irretrievable after they have been delivered. You may preview our templates before purchase to ensure it is exactly what you are looking for. By purchasing our documentation templates or documentation toolkits, you understand and
        agree to the terms outlined herein. However, there are circumstances that would allow us to offer you a refund for your purchased template, and they are as follows: (1) the product was not delivered to you, or (2) you were unable to download
        the file we provided, or you are unable to save or open the template.
        All decisions on refunds and our policies therein are subject to our discretion. As such, we may require screenshots of errors received, or other proofs. We will make every attempt to ensure the product is up to your standards as well as ours
        before we issue a refund.
      </p>

      <h2 class="termsection-heading">GOVERNING LAW</h2>

        These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of South Africa, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

        remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Website and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Website.
